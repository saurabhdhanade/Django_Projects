# Django_Projects
This is my first freelancing Project, which is given by warje water treatment plant’s Manager. They want a simple informative website for their plant. The main aim of this website to collect employee information because they don’t have any resource to contact with them. 
The start to end all front end and back end coding is done by me. After that I host this application on python anywhere.com on free domain for 3 months of duration.
